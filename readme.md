Understanding of why we are doing this project

### Design Choices

**Color Palette**

- **Light Blue**: `#ace5ee`  
  Rationale: This soft, calming shade of blue was chosen to create a welcoming and serene atmosphere for the design. It gives the webpage a light, airy feel and conveys trust and reliability.
- **Dark Blue**: `#97c0ea`  
  Rationale: This darker blue adds depth and contrast, providing visual hierarchy and making important elements stand out, such as headings and calls to action. It complements the light blue while maintaining a cohesive look.
- **Periwinkle**: `#bdcded`  
  Rationale: This subtle plum color adds a touch of sophistication and warmth to the design. It was used for accents and subtle details, creating a balanced contrast with the blues.
- **White**: `#FFFFFF`  
  Rationale: White serves as the primary text color, offering clarity and space. It enhances the readability of text and creates a clean, modern feel that lets the other colors shine.

**Top-Level Layout Decisions**

- **Hero Section**: A full-width hero image with a light blue background was used to establish the overall tone of the webpage. The dark blue text stands out against the soft background, creating an inviting focal point.
- **Navigation**: A minimal, fixed navigation bar is placed at the top for easy access to key sections. The white background ensures that the navigation remains subtle and doesn't overpower the design.
- **Content Sections**: The content is laid out in clean, well-defined sections with ample spacing to create a sense of openness. Each section is color-coded with light blue, dark blue, or plum backgrounds to create visual contrast and guide the user through the page.
- **Typography**: A modern sans-serif font was chosen for its readability, paired with bold headings in dark blue to highlight key content areas. The typography complements the color palette, maintaining a professional yet approachable look.
